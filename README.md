android-md-core
================

`AppCompat` and `Google Support Design` are really awesome but they also have some limitations. Theming android app is not an easy task, especially keeping consistent UI on both Lollipop and Non-Lollipop devices is even harder. If you've tried `CardView`, you know what I mean. So, I propose `android-md-core` - Material bootstrap for Android development.
